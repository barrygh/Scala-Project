	<h1>History</h1>
		<p>
			Scala was created by Martin Odersky in 2001 and was first released on January 20, 2004.
			Its selling point was that it was a fully object-oriented language that also fully supported
			functional programming. The most current version is 2.12.2. 
			The creator of Scala had been involved in the development of the Java programming language,
			and this likely had an effect on his design choices for Scala.
		</p>
	<h1>Paradigm</h1>
		<p>
			Scala is both fully object-oriented and functional. This is the main characteristic that
			sets it apart from other languages, making this is one of their main ways of marketing
			it. 
		</p>
	<h1>Typing System</h1>
		<p>
			Although Scala is a statically typed language, one can make the argument that the typing
			can be relatively weak since Scala supports type inference (that is, types do not have to
			be explicitly declared since Scala can 'figure it out'). That said, type declarations can
			still be done and new types can be made if created and imported from within a class.
		</p>
	<h1>Control Structures</h1>
		<p>
			Standard if-else statements as well as for and while/do-while loops are supported. Of course,
			since this language is also functional there are other control options, such as pattern
			matching (it is most often compared to Java's switch control structure).
		</p>
	<h1>Support for Data Abstractions</h1>
		<p>
			The abstraction provided in Scala is very similar to Java. Some bonus features include creating types that
			are members of objects and having the flexibility of almost everything being an expression. Traits are 
			collections of fields and behaviors that you can extend or min in to your classes. They allow classification
			of some classes to be much easier. One other abstraction that we used in our project was a BeanProperty
			import to help with our getters.
		</p>
	<h1>Syntax</h1>
		<p>
			The syntax in scala is very user-friendly. It does not require any semicolons which is useful. We also liked how
			method calls that didn't take any perameters didn't require parentheses. I think the variable declaration syntax
			is a little bit confusing. It doesn't make much sense to us because it strives to be a better Java, but the
			variable declarations look much messier.
		</p>
	<h1>Semantics</h1>
		<p>
			Similar to Java, Scala is lexically scoped. It also follows the same storage allocation guidelines as Java with 
			heap-dynamic allocation. As for garbage collection, unreferenced objects get collected rather quickly. This is 
			again very similar to Java. Scala's constants are called vals, and are used similarly to Java's static final 
			variables.
		</p>
	<h1>Desirable Language Characteristics</h1>
		<p>
			Efficiency - In terms of execution, Scala is one of the fastest languages out there. It also contains a wide range
			of different language characteristics. I like to think of Scala as a mix between Haskell and Java. This variability
			makes implementation efficient as well.
			
			Regularity - Scala has many cool features that were produced to handle specific situations that lead to only one
			way to do things. For example, Scala's BeanProperty takes arguments from a constructor and automatically creates
			getters for them, eliminating the need for any other implementation.

			Security - Variables have a very flexible way of typing that lead to issues sometimes, but in most cases makes the 
			user's experience a lot easier. Vars are used to be either typed specifically or to another expression and 
			automatically figure out their type. This allows for flexibility and less errors.
