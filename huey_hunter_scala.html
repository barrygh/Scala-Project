	<h1>History</h1>
		<p>
			Scala was created by Martin Odersky in 2001 and was first released on January 20, 2004.
			Its selling point was that it was a fully object-oriented language that also fully supported
			functional programming. The most current version is 2.12.2. 
			The creator of Scala had been involved in the development of the Java programming language,
			and this likely had an effect on his design choices for Scala.
		</p>
	<h1>Paradigm</h1>
		<p>
			Scala is both fully object-oriented and functional. This is the main characteristic that
			sets it apart from other languages, making this is one of their main ways of marketing
			it.
