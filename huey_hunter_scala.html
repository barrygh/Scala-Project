	<h1>History</h1>
		<p>
			Scala was created by Martin Odersky in 2001 and was first released on January 20, 2004.
			Its selling point was that it was a fully object-oriented language that also fully supported
			functional programming. The most current version is 2.12.2. 
			The creator of Scala had been involved in the development of the Java programming language,
			and this likely had an effect on his design choices for Scala.
		</p>
	<h1>Paradigm</h1>
		<p>
			Scala is both fully object-oriented and functional. This is the main characteristic that
			sets it apart from other languages, making this is one of their main ways of marketing
			it. 
		</p>
	<h1>Typing System</h1>
		<p>
			Although Scala is a statically typed language, one can make the argument that the typing
			can be relatively weak since Scala supports type inference (that is, types do not have to
			be explicitly declared since Scala can 'figure it out'). That said, type declarations can
			still be done and new types can be made if created and imported from within a class.
		</p>
	<h1>Control Structures</h1>
		<p>
			Standard if-else statements as well as for and while/do-while loops are supported. Of course,
			since this language is also functional there are other control options, such as pattern
			matching (it is most often compared to Java's switch control structure).
